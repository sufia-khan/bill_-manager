# Archived Bills Delete Fix - Safety Checks Added ‚úÖ

## Issue

When deleting bills from the Archived Bills screen, the system was deleting bills from all tabs (including active paid bills in the Paid tab), not just archived bills.

## Root Cause

The `deleteBill()` function in `BillProvider` had no safety checks to verify if a bill was archived before deletion. It would delete any bill by ID.

## Solution

Added safety checks to ensure **only archived bills can be deleted**.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `deleteBill()` Function

**File:** `lib/providers/bill_provider.dart`

**Added Safety Check:**
```dart
Future<void> deleteBill(String billId) async {
  try {
    final bill = HiveService.getBillById(billId);
    
    // Safety check: Only allow deletion of archived bills
    if (bill == null) {
      throw Exception('Bill not found');
    }
    
    if (!bill.isArchived) {
      throw Exception('Cannot delete non-archived bill. Only archived bills can be deleted.');
    }

    // Proceed with deletion...
  }
}
```

**What it does:**
- ‚úÖ Checks if bill exists
- ‚úÖ Verifies bill is archived
- ‚úÖ Throws error if trying to delete non-archived bill
- ‚úÖ Prevents accidental deletion of active bills

---

### 2. Added `deleteArchivedBill()` Wrapper

**File:** `lib/providers/bill_provider.dart`

**New Safe Function:**
```dart
Future<void> deleteArchivedBill(String billId) async {
  try {
    final bill = HiveService.getBillById(billId);
    
    if (bill == null) {
      throw Exception('Bill not found');
    }
    
    if (!bill.isArchived) {
      throw Exception('Bill is not archived. Only archived bills can be deleted.');
    }

    await deleteBill(billId);
  }
}
```

**Purpose:**
- Explicit function name makes intent clear
- Double safety check
- Can be used for extra safety in UI

## How It Works Now

### Manual Deletion (Swipe or Delete All)

```
User swipes bill in Archived Bills screen
    ‚Üì
Call billProvider.deleteBill(billId)
    ‚Üì
Check: Is bill archived? ‚úì
    ‚Üì
Yes ‚Üí Delete bill
No ‚Üí Throw error (prevents deletion)
```

### Auto-Deletion (90 Days)

```
App starts ‚Üí Maintenance runs
    ‚Üì
Get all archived bills (already filtered)
    ‚Üì
Find bills archived 90+ days ago
    ‚Üì
For each eligible bill:
  - Verify it's archived ‚úì
  - Delete bill
```

---

## Safety Guarantees

### ‚úÖ What CAN Be Deleted

1. **Archived Bills** - Bills with `isArchived = true`
2. **Old Archived Bills** - Archived 90+ days ago
3. **From Archived Screen** - Only shows archived bills

### ‚ùå What CANNOT Be Deleted

1. **Active Bills** - Bills in Upcoming tab
2. **Overdue Bills** - Bills in Overdue tab
3. **Paid Bills** - Bills in Paid tab (not yet archived)
4. **Any Non-Archived Bill** - Safety check prevents it

---

## Bill Lifecycle with Delete Protection

```
Day 0: Bill created (Upcoming)
    ‚ùå Cannot delete - not archived
    ‚Üì
Day X: Bill overdue (Overdue)
    ‚ùå Cannot delete - not archived
    ‚Üì
Day Y: Bill paid (Paid tab)
    ‚ùå Cannot delete - not archived
    ‚Üì
Day Y+30: Bill archived (Archived Bills screen)
    ‚úÖ CAN delete manually
    ‚Üì
Day Y+120: Auto-deleted (90 days after archival)
    ‚úÖ Auto-deleted by system
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Delete from Archived Screen
```
Given: Bill is in Archived Bills screen
When: User swipes to delete
Then: Bill is deleted successfully
```

### Scenario 2: Try to Delete Active Bill
```
Given: Bill is in Paid tab (not archived)
When: System tries to delete bill
Then: Error thrown, bill NOT deleted
```

### Scenario 3: Auto-Delete Old Bills
```
Given: Bill archived 90+ days ago
When: App starts and maintenance runs
Then: Bill is auto-deleted
```

### Scenario 4: Auto-Delete Recent Bills
```
Given: Bill archived 29 days ago
When: App starts and maintenance runs
Then: Bill is NOT deleted (not old enough)
```

## Error Messages

### Trying to Delete Non-Archived Bill
```
Error: Cannot delete non-archived bill. Only archived bills can be deleted.
```

### Bill Not Found
```
Error: Bill not found
```

---

## Code Flow

### Delete Single Bill (Swipe)

```dart
// In archived_bills_screen.dart
onDismissed: (direction) async {
  await billProvider.deleteBill(bill.id);  // ‚Üê Has safety check
  // Show success message
}
```

### Delete All Bills

```dart
// In archived_bills_screen.dart
for (final bill in archivedBills) {  // ‚Üê Already filtered to archived only
  await billProvider.deleteBill(bill.id);  // ‚Üê Has safety check
}
```

### Auto-Delete (90 Days)

```dart
// In bill_archival_service.dart
final archivedBills = HiveService.getArchivedBills();  // ‚Üê Only archived
final eligibleBills = archivedBills.where((bill) {
  return daysSinceArchival >= 90;  // ‚Üê Only old ones
}).toList();

for (final bill in eligibleBills) {
  await HiveService.deleteBill(bill.id);  // ‚Üê Safe to delete
}
```
