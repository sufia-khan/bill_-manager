# Notification Fix - Quick Reference

## What Was Fixed

Your scheduled notifications weren't working because the app was using only `flutter_local_notifications`, which doesn't reliably work when the app is closed or the phone is locked.

## Solution Implemented

Added **android_alarm_manager_plus** package that uses Android's native AlarmManager API - the same system used by alarm clock apps. This ensures notifications work even when:
- ‚úÖ App is completely closed
- ‚úÖ Phone is locked
- ‚úÖ Phone is rebooted
- ‚úÖ Battery saver is on

## How to Test

### Test 1: Immediate Notification (Sanity Check)
1. Open app ‚Üí Settings
2. Tap "Test Notification (Immediate)"
3. Should see notification instantly ‚úÖ

### Test 2: Alarm Notification (Main Test)
1. Open app ‚Üí Settings
2. Tap "Test Alarm Notification"
3. **IMPORTANT: Close the app completely** (swipe away from recent apps)
4. Wait 10 seconds
5. You should get a notification! üéâ

### Test 3: Real Bill Notification
1. Add a bill with due date tomorrow
2. The app will automatically schedule a notification
3. Close the app
4. At 9 AM tomorrow, you'll get the notification

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Added New Package
```yaml
android_alarm_manager_plus: ^4.0.3
```

### 2. Updated Android Permissions
Added to `AndroidManifest.xml`:
- SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM (for precise timing)
- WAKE_LOCK (to wake device)
- RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED (reschedule after reboot)

### 3. Created New Service
`lib/services/alarm_notification_service.dart` - Handles all alarm scheduling

### 4. Updated Main Service
`lib/services/notification_service.dart` - Now uses alarm service for scheduling

### 5. Added Test Button
Settings screen now has "Test Alarm Notification" button

## Important Notes

### Permissions Required
On Android 12+, users need to grant "Alarms & reminders" permission:
```
Settings > Apps > BillManager > Alarms & reminders > Allow
```

The app will prompt for this automatically.

### How It Works
```
Add Bill ‚Üí Schedule Alarm ‚Üí Android AlarmManager ‚Üí 
Trigger at Time ‚Üí Wake Device ‚Üí Show Notification
```

### Notification Timing
- Bills due today: Notification at 9 AM
- Bills due tomorrow: Notification at 9 AM (1 day before)
- Bills due in 7 days: Notification at 9 AM (7 days before)

You can customize these in notification settings.

## Troubleshooting

### "Notification didn't appear"

**Check 1**: Notification permission
```
Settings > Apps > BillManager > Notifications > ON
```

**Check 2**: Exact alarms permission (Android 12+)
```
Settings > Apps > BillManager > Alarms & reminders > Allow
```

**Check 3**: Battery optimization
```
Settings > Apps > BillManager > Battery > Unrestricted
```

**Check 4**: Do Not Disturb mode
Make sure it's off or allows notifications

### "Test alarm notification not working"

1. Make sure you **closed the app completely** (not just minimized)
2. Wait the full 10 seconds
3. Check notification shade (swipe down from top)
4. Check app logs for errors

### View Debug Info
Settings > "View Scheduled Notifications" shows all pending notifications

## Files Modified

1. `pubspec.yaml` - Added android_alarm_manager_plus
2. `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Added permissions
3. `lib/services/alarm_notification_service.dart` - NEW FILE
4. `lib/services/notification_service.dart` - Updated to use alarm service
5. `lib/main.dart` - Initialize alarm service
6. `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart` - Added test button

## Next Steps

1. **Test the alarm notification** using the test button
2. **Add a real bill** with due date tomorrow
3. **Close the app** and wait for notification
4. **Verify** you receive the notification at scheduled time

## Why This Works Better

**Old System**: App schedules notification ‚Üí Phone might kill app ‚Üí Notification lost ‚ùå

**New System**: App registers alarm with Android ‚Üí Android guarantees alarm fires ‚Üí Notification delivered ‚úÖ

This is the same reliable system used by:
- Alarm clock apps
- Calendar reminders
- Messaging apps
- Any app that needs guaranteed notifications

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Immediate test notification works
‚úÖ Alarm test notification works (app closed)
‚úÖ Bill notifications arrive at scheduled time
‚úÖ Notifications work after phone reboot
‚úÖ Notifications work with battery saver on

---

**You're all set!** Your bill notifications will now work reliably, just like an alarm clock. üîî
