- **Line 2:** Category (gray text)
- **Amount:** On the right side

**Before:**
```
Bill Name
Bill Name  ← duplicate
```

**After:**
```
Bill Name
Category Name  ← correct
```

### 2. ✅ Added Formatted Amount Feature

**Compact Amounts with Info Icon:**
- Shows shortened amounts (e.g., "₹1.2M" instead of "₹1,234,567")
- Info icon appears when amount is formatted
- Tap icon to see full amount in bottom sheet
- Works in both summary card and individual bill cards

**Dialog:**
```
"Are you sure you want to delete all X archived bills?"
⚠️ This action cannot be undone

**New Feature:** Automatic deletion of old archived bills

**Timeline:**
```
Day 1: Bill paid
