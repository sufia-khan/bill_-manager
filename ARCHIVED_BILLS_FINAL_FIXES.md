# Archived Bills Screen - Final Fixes ✅

## All Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Removed Vendor Name from Status Row
**Issue:** Vendor name was showing next to "Paid" status  
**Fix:** Removed vendor name from the bottom row

**Before:**
```
[Paid] Vendor Name    [Restore]
```

**After:**
```
[Paid]                [Restore]
```

---

### 2. ✅ Fixed Restore Button Alignment
**Issue:** Restore button wasn't aligned with amount on right side  
**Fix:** Used `Spacer()` to push restore button to the right, matching amount position

**Layout:**
```
Title                 Amount [i]
Category

Due: 24 Oct 2025  Paid: 20 Nov 2025

[Paid]                [Restore]
```

---

### 3. ✅ Fixed Restore Functionality
**Issue:** Restored bills weren't disappearing from archived list  
**Fix:** Added `setState(() {})` after restore to force UI refresh

**Code:**
```dart
await billProvider.restoreBill(bill.id);
// Force refresh to remove from archived list
setState(() {});
```

**Now works correctly:**
- Restore bill → Bill unarchived in database
- UI refreshes → Bill disappears from archived list
- Bill appears in Paid tab

---

### 4. ✅ Added Due Date and Paid Date
**Issue:** No dates were showing on bill cards  
**Fix:** Added a new row showing both dates with icons

**Display:**
```
📅 Due: 24 Oct 2025    ✓ Paid: 20 Nov 2025
```

**Features:**
- Calendar icon for due date
- Check icon for paid date
- Formatted as "dd MMM yyyy" (e.g., "24 Oct 2025")
- Shows "N/A" if paid date is missing

## Complete Bill Card Layout

### Final Layout:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Bill Name                  ₹1.2M [i]    │
│ Category Name                           │

│                                         │
│ [Paid]                      [Restore]   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Swipe Left to Delete:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ← Swipe                        🗑️ Delete│
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
