## Testing Setup

### For Testing: Shows Every Time
The onboarding currently shows **every time you open the app** (for testing purposes).

**Modified Files:**
- `lib/main.dart` - Added onboarding trigger on app start
- `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart` - Added "View Onboarding" button

### How to Test

1. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Onboarding will automatically show** after login

3. **Or manually open from Settings:**
   - Go to Settings screen
   - Tap "View Onboarding" button
   - View the full onboarding flow

## Navigation Flow

```
App Start â†’ Login â†’ Onboarding (auto-shows) â†’ Home Screen
                         â†“
                    (Swipe through 6 screens)
                         â†“
                  Tap "Create Account" or "Sign In"
                         â†“
                    Returns to Home
```

## Color Scheme

- **Primary Orange**: `#FF8C00` (your brand color)
- **Pink/Red**: `#EC4899` to `#EF4444` (Notifications)
- **Purple/Pink**: `#8B5CF6` to `#EC4899` (Analytics)
- **Green/Teal**: `#10B981` to `#14B8A6` (Security)

## Production Setup (Later)

When ready for production, you'll want to:

1. **Show onboarding only once** using SharedPreferences
2. **Remove the auto-show** from `main.dart`
3. **Keep the Settings button** for users to review features

### Example Production Code:
```dart
// Check if user has seen onboarding
final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
final hasSeenOnboarding = prefs.getBool('hasSeenOnboarding') ?? false;

if (!hasSeenOnboarding) {
  // Show onboarding
  await Navigator.push(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => const OnboardingScreen()),
  );
  // Mark as seen
  await prefs.setBool('hasSeenOnboarding', true);
}
```

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `lib/screens/onboarding_screen.dart` - NEW FILE
2. âœ… `lib/main.dart` - Added onboarding import and auto-show logic
3. âœ… `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart` - Added "View Onboarding" button

## Ready to Test! ðŸš€

Run your app and the onboarding will show automatically. Enjoy the beautiful screens!
