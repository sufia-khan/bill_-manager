# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing recurring bill automation and historical bill management in the BillManager application. The feature enables automatic creation of recurring bills, maintains a 30-day visibility window for paid/overdue bills, and provides a comprehensive history section for past records.

## Glossary

- **BillManager**: The bill management application system
- **Recurring Bill**: A bill that repeats on a defined schedule (monthly, yearly, etc.)
- **Past Bills Section**: A separate storage area for paid bills older than 30 days after payment
- **Payment Date**: The timestamp when a bill's status changes to paid
- **Billing Cycle**: The time period between recurring bill instances
- **Active Bill**: A bill visible on the main screen (upcoming bills, overdue bills, or paid bills within 30 days of payment)
- **Archived Bill**: A paid bill moved to the Past Bills Section after 30-day visibility period

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Recurring Bill Auto-Addition

### Requirement 2: 30-Day Visibility Window for Paid Bills

5. WHEN a bill is upcoming, THE BillManager SHALL never archive it regardless of age
