## How It Works

### Marking a Bill as Paid
1. User taps "Manage" on a bill card
2. User taps "Mark as Paid" button
3. Bill is marked as paid and appears in the Paid tab
4. Success snackbar appears with "View" button to switch to Paid tab
5. If the bill is recurring, a new instance is created automatically

### Undoing a Payment
1. User switches to the Paid tab
2. User taps "Manage" on a paid bill
3. User taps "Undo Payment" button
4. Bill is reverted to unpaid status
5. Bill moves back to Upcoming or Overdue tab based on due date
6. Notification is rescheduled for the bill

## Benefits

- **Simpler Navigation**: No need for a separate history screen
- **Better Visibility**: Users can easily see their paid bills in the Paid tab
- **Undo Capability**: Users can correct mistakes if they mark a bill as paid accidentally
- **Consistent UI**: All bill management happens in one place (home screen)
- **Less Clutter**: Removed unnecessary screen and navigation complexity

## Testing Recommendations

1. Mark a bill as paid and verify it appears in the Paid tab
2. Click "View" in the snackbar to verify it switches to Paid tab
3. Open a paid bill and verify "Undo Payment" button appears
4. Undo a payment and verify the bill returns to the correct tab
5. Mark a recurring bill as paid and verify a new instance is created
6. Verify notifications are cancelled when marking as paid
7. Verify notifications are rescheduled when undoing payment
