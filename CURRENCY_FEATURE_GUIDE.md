# Currency Feature - Fully Functional! 💱

## What's New

The currency selector is now **fully functional** and changes currency throughout the entire app with smooth loading states!

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Persistent Currency Selection** 💾
- Selected currency is saved to local storage (Hive)
- Automatically loads on app startup
- Persists across app restarts

### 2. **Loading States** ⏳
- Shows circular progress indicator while changing currency
- Disables currency selector during loading
- Smooth 500ms transition for better UX

### 3. **App-Wide Currency Updates** 🌍
- Currency changes apply to **ALL** screens instantly:
  - ✅ Bill Manager Screen
  - ✅ Analytics Screen
  - ✅ Calendar Screen
  - ✅ Past Bills Screen
  - ✅ Bill Details
  - ✅ Add Bill Screen
  - ✅ All charts and graphs

### 4. **Success Notification** ✅
- Green success message with checkmark
- Shows: "Currency changed to [CODE] • All amounts updated!"
- Auto-dismisses after 3 seconds

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. **Open Settings** → Tap on "Currency" option
2. **Select Currency** → Choose from 150+ currencies
3. **Loading State** → See spinner while saving (500ms)
4. **Success!** → Green notification confirms change
5. **Instant Update** → All amounts throughout app update immediately

### Technical Implementation:

```dart
// Currency is loaded on app startup
CurrencyProvider()..loadSavedCurrency()

// When user changes currency:
await currencyProvider.setCurrency(currency, convert, rate);
// ↓
// 1. Shows loading spinner
// 2. Saves to Hive storage
// 3. Notifies all listeners
// 4. All screens rebuild with new currency
```

### Storage Keys:
- `currency_code` - e.g., "USD", "EUR", "INR"
- `currency_convert` - boolean for conversion
- `currency_rate` - conversion rate
