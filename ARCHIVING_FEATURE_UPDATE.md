# Archiving Feature Update - Complete! ✅

## Changes Made

### 1. ⏰ Changed Archiving Period: 2 Days → 30 Days

**File:** `lib/services/bill_archival_service.dart`

**Before:**
```dart
// Must wait 2 days after payment before archiving
final daysSincePayment = now.difference(bill.paidAt!).inDays;
return daysSincePayment >= 2;
```

**After:**
```dart
// Must wait 30 days after payment before archiving
final daysSincePayment = now.difference(bill.paidAt!).inDays;
return daysSincePayment >= 30;
```

**Impact:** Bills now stay visible in the "Paid" tab for 30 days before being automatically archived.

  final updatedBill = bill.copyWith(
    isArchived: false,
    archivedAt: null,
    updatedAt: now,
    clientUpdatedAt: now,
    needsSync: true,
  );
  await HiveService.saveBill(updatedBill);
  // Refresh and sync...
}
```
